# Frontend Design Guide — AllAboutXRP

## Design Thinking
Before coding, commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- Purpose, tone, constraints, differentiation
- What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

## Typography
- Choose distinctive, characterful fonts (NOT Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font
- Current: Instrument Sans, DM Sans, JetBrains Mono — evolve if needed

## Color & Theme
- Cohesive aesthetic with CSS variables
- Dominant colors with sharp accents > timid evenly-distributed palettes
- Current: #0D1117 bg, #00A3FF accent — can push further

## Motion & Animation
- High-impact page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay)
- Scroll-triggered animations, surprising hover states
- CSS-only for HTML, Motion library for React
- One orchestrated entrance > scattered micro-interactions

## Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

## Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth, NOT solid color blocks
- Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, grain overlays
- Custom cursors, decorative borders

## NEVER
- Generic AI aesthetics (purple gradients on white)
- Overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, Space Grotesk)
- Predictable cookie-cutter layouts
- Same design across pages — each page should feel unique but cohesive

## Production Requirements
- Working, functional code
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail
