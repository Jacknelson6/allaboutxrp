### 2. ⛓️ XRPL Activates Token Escrow (XLS-85)

### 3. 📉 Exchange Reserves Hit Multi-Month Low
Exchange-held XRP dropped by 700 million tokens since November, continuing a sustained withdrawal trend. Reduced exchange supply often correlates with decreased selling pressure and long-term holder accumulation.

## 🔮 What to Watch Next Week

1. **$1.55 resistance retest** — Can XRP hold above the 50-day MA on daily timeframes? A close above $1.55 would be technically significant.

2. **XLS-85 adoption** — Watch for the first projects to utilize Token Escrow for stablecoin or RWA settlement on XRPL.

3. **Ripple-Zand details** — Expect more specifics on the UAE partnership scope — payment corridors, volume targets, and timeline.

4. **Exchange reserve trend** — The 700M XRP withdrawal trend is worth monitoring. Further drops could signal a supply squeeze.

5. **Macro backdrop** — Bitcoin's price action and broader crypto sentiment will continue to influence XRP's range. Watch for any Fed commentary or regulatory news.
