The XRP Ledger was built by three visionary engineers: Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. Development began in 2011, and the ledger launched in June 2012.

Jed McCaleb, previously known for founding Mt. Gox (the first major Bitcoin exchange) and later Stellar, conceived the initial idea. David Schwartz, now Ripple's CTO, architected the core consensus protocol. Arthur Britto contributed fundamental design work on the ledger's architecture.

Together, they created a blockchain that could process transactions in seconds rather than minutes, using a fraction of the energy of proof-of-work systems. The trio later co-founded the company now known as Ripple to develop enterprise solutions on the technology.
