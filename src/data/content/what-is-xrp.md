XRP is a digital asset native to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), an open-source, decentralized blockchain created in 2012. Designed specifically for payments, XRP can settle transactions in just 3-5 seconds with fees less than a fraction of a cent.

Unlike Bitcoin, which uses energy-intensive proof-of-work mining, the XRP Ledger uses a unique consensus protocol that is fast, energy-efficient, and environmentally sustainable. The network can handle approximately 1,500 transactions per second.

100 billion XRP were created at the ledger's genesis — no more can ever be minted. Small amounts of XRP are burned with every transaction, making it slightly deflationary over time. XRP serves as both a bridge currency for cross-border payments and a utility token powering the XRPL ecosystem.
