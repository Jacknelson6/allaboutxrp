The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is one of the most established public blockchains in existence, running continuously since 2012. It uses a unique Federated Byzantine Agreement consensus protocol that doesn't require mining or staking.

Key features of the XRPL include a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), native token issuance, NFT support (XLS-20), automated market makers (AMMs), escrow, payment channels, and multi-signing. The ledger settles transactions in 3-5 seconds with near-zero fees.

The XRPL is maintained by a global network of validators. While Ripple runs some validators, they represent a minority of the network. The XRPL Foundation, an independent nonprofit, supports the ecosystem through grants, governance, and community building.
