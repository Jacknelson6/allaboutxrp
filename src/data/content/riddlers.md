# The XRP Riddlers: A Comprehensive Guide

*The definitive resource on the cryptic figures, predictions, and decoded messages that define XRP's most unique cultural phenomenon.*

---

## What Are the XRP Riddlers?

The XRP Riddlers are a collection of anonymous and pseudonymous figures who post cryptic images, riddles, numerical codes, and symbolic artwork across platforms like Twitter/X, Reddit, and YouTube — all centered around XRP, Ripple, and the broader financial system. The XRP community actively decodes these messages, interpreting them as insider knowledge, price predictions, or prophetic timelines.

This phenomenon is **unique to XRP**. While other crypto communities have influencers and analysts, no other digital asset has developed such an elaborate, mythology-driven culture of cryptic puzzle-solving. The Riddler tradition blends numerology, symbolism, geopolitics, and financial speculation into something that resembles part treasure hunt, part religious prophecy, part community folklore.

The Riddler culture emerged around 2017–2018 and has sustained itself through the years of the SEC lawsuit, price suppression, and the long wait for what believers call XRP's inevitable "moment."

## BearableGuy123 (BG123)

### Who Is BearableGuy123?

BearableGuy123 — often abbreviated as BG123 — is widely considered the **original XRP Riddler** and the most influential figure in the tradition. Active primarily on Twitter and Reddit (notably the r/Ripple and r/Rippled subreddits) during 2017–2019, BG123 posted a series of cryptic comic-style images, hand-drawn panels, and coded messages that the XRP community has analyzed obsessively ever since.

BG123's identity has never been confirmed. The community has long speculated that BG123 is a **Ripple insider** — possibly an employee, early investor, or someone with connections to Ripple's executive team — based on the perceived accuracy of certain predictions and the specificity of the imagery used.

### The Famous Posts

#### The $589 Prediction

The most iconic element of BG123's legacy is the alleged prediction that **XRP would reach $589**. This number was derived from the community's interpretation of BG123's visual symbolism — specifically, images featuring sequences that could be decoded as "5-8-9." The original prediction was tied to **December 31, 2018**, which obviously did not materialize at the time.

Despite the miss on timing, the $589 figure became a **cultural totem** for the XRP community — a symbol of faith in XRP's long-term potential that transcends rational price analysis. It has taken on a life far beyond BG123's original posts.

#### The Comic Panels

BG123's posts were distinctive for their **hand-drawn comic style**, featuring recurring characters and symbols:

- **Three colored pillars or snowballs** — often blue, gold, and green — interpreted as representing XRP, BTC, and USD (or fiat currencies). In some panels, four snowballs were reduced to three, suggesting only three currencies would survive.
- **A broken crown** — interpreted as the fall of the existing financial order.
- **A figure chiseling stone** — symbolizing the patient, deliberate work of building something permanent.
- **A purple beret** on the BearableGuy character — linked to perseverance and identity.
- **The Phoenix rising** — connected to The Economist's famous 1988 cover predicting a world currency by 2018, interpreted as XRP rising from the ashes of the old financial system.
- **The Triskelion symbol** — a triple spiral motif linked to cycles, progress, and transformation.

#### The Lodestar Messages

In 2019, BG123 released a series known as the **"Lodestar Messages"** (1, 2, and 3), which hinted at major developments including regulations, partnerships, and institutional adoption. These were dense with metaphor and symbolism, and the community spent weeks decoding each one.

#### Coinbase and Partnership Hints

Several of BG123's images appeared to hint at upcoming events before they were publicly announced — including imagery that the community interpreted as referencing the **Coinbase listing of XRP** and the **MoneyGram partnership**. These apparent "hits" fueled the belief that BG123 had inside knowledge.

### Timeline

| Period | Activity |
|--------|----------|
| **Late 2017 – Early 2018** | BG123 emerges on Twitter and Reddit with cryptic comics |
| **Mid 2018** | Peak activity; the $589 prediction gains traction |
| **Late 2018** | r/Rippled subreddit shuts down; BG123 goes quiet |
| **Early 2019** | Subreddit reopens; Lodestar Messages released |
| **2019 onwards** | BG123 largely disappears; legacy lives on through community analysis |

### Why the Community Believes BG123 Is an Insider

- **Apparent foreknowledge** of events like Coinbase listings and partnerships
- **Specificity of symbolism** that aligned with Ripple's actual strategy
- **Timing of posts** relative to market-moving announcements
- **The professional quality** of the artwork and the layered nature of the messages
- **The deliberate disappearance** — interpreted as someone who said what they needed to say and left

## Mr. Pool

### Who Is Mr. Pool?

Mr. Pool is the handle behind the X (Twitter) account **@looP_rM311_7211** — a pseudonymous poster who has become one of the most discussed and analyzed figures in the XRP Riddler community. The account name itself is considered a riddle (note "looP" reversed is "Pool," and the numbers 7211 have been decoded in various ways by the community).

Mr. Pool posts **cryptic images, timestamps, symbols, and numerical patterns** that the community interprets as predictions about XRP price movements, regulatory events, geopolitical developments, and financial system resets.

### The Style

Unlike BG123's hand-drawn comics, Mr. Pool's posts tend to be:

- **Images with embedded clues** — clocks showing specific times (1:33, 11:13), calendar markings, smiling faces, and symbolic objects
- **Numerical patterns** — sequences decoded through multiplication (x2+3, x2-1), date formats (113 = November 3 or January 13), and countdown structures
- **Timeline predictions** — including references to "44 days," "77 days," and "Plan B activation"
- **Minimal or no text** — the images speak for themselves, requiring community decoding

### Key Predictions and Interpretations

Community decodings of Mr. Pool's riddles have suggested:

- **Phased price surges**: Double digits ($10+) in September, triple digits ($100+) in October, quadruple digits ($1,000+) in November, five-digit levels ($10,000+) by December — though timelines and years are debated
- **Smiling faces** signaling upcoming crypto pumps for XRP, Dogecoin, and others
- **Clock times** matching timestamps from Ripple executives' posts (e.g., David Schwartz posting "11:13," mirroring Mr. Pool's clock imagery)
- **Connection to real-world events** — some community members linked Mr. Pool's timeline posts to events like the Beirut explosion and regulatory announcements

### Connections to Ripple

The community has noted stylistic and timing overlaps between Mr. Pool's posts and official Ripple imagery:

- **Ripple's X account background** has featured imagery (euro receipts, clocks, Wall Street bull statues) that mirrors Mr. Pool's visual language
- **David Schwartz's cryptic tweets** sometimes echo Mr. Pool's numerical patterns
- **Timing correlations** between Mr. Pool's posts and Ripple announcements

No direct connection has ever been confirmed. Mr. Pool has never identified themselves or acknowledged any Ripple affiliation.

### The Scribd Document

A detailed community analysis exists as a Scribd document titled *"An XRP Theory Based on Mr. Pool (@looP_rM311_7211) Riddles"* — a comprehensive attempt to decode the full body of Mr. Pool's work, connecting it to XRP timelines, financial resets, and geopolitical events. This document has become a key reference in the Riddler community.

## The Number 589

### Origin

The number **589** originated from BearableGuy123's cryptic comic panels in 2018, where community members decoded visual elements as representing the sequence 5-8-9. This was interpreted as a **price prediction: $589 per XRP**.

What began as one community's interpretation of one riddler's artwork has since become the **single most iconic number in XRP culture** — a phenomenon that has taken on a life of its own, independent of BG123.

### The Coincidences

What makes 589 so compelling to the community isn't just the original prediction — it's the **seemingly impossible number of coincidences** that have appeared over the years:

| Discovery | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Ripple's USPTO Trademark** | XRP's trademark registration number is **4,458,993** — containing "589" within the digits. Filed May 17, 2013; granted December 31, 2013. |
| **Brad Garlinghouse's Twitter Follows** | Ripple's CEO has maintained exactly **589 follows** on X (Twitter) for an extended period — a number the community considers deliberately chosen. |
| **Hidden Road's Address** | Hidden Road, the prime brokerage firm acquired by Ripple, is headquartered at **589 Fifth Avenue**, New York. |
| **RLUSD Application Serial** | Ripple's stablecoin RLUSD trademark application serial number **98537677** contains a "589" pattern when decoded through community numerology methods. |
| **PolySign Patent** | A PolySign patent reference reportedly contains the 589 sequence. |
| **Comex Rule 589** | COMEX Rule 589 governs price limits for metals futures — interpreted by the community as a hint about XRP's role in a gold-backed financial system. |
| **ISO 4217 Currency Code Slot** | Slot 589 in the ISO 4217 standard (which assigns three-letter codes to currencies) is unassigned — leading to speculation it's reserved for XRP or RLUSD. |

### The Simpsons Connection

A purported screenshot from *The Simpsons* showing a $589 XRP prediction circulated widely but has been **debunked as a forgery**. Despite this, it contributed to the cultural momentum around the number.

### What 589 Means Today

For the XRP community, 589 functions as something between a price target, a lucky number, and a **statement of faith**. Whether interpreted literally as $589, as $5.89, or simply as a symbol of XRP's destiny, the number unites the community in a shared narrative. It appears in profile bios, memes, and community art. It is the "42" of the XRP universe — the answer to everything, requiring no further explanation among believers.

## David Schwartz: The Accidental Riddler

While not a "riddler" in the traditional sense, **David Schwartz** — Ripple's former CTO (now CTO Emeritus as of January 2026) — has become an integral part of Riddler lore through his own history of **cryptic tweets** on X.

### Notable Cryptic Posts

| Post | Community Interpretation |
|------|------------------------|
| **"10x times" bubble can image** | 10x price increase for XRP (to $10+) |
| **"Lock In"** (December 8, 2024) | XRP staking feature incoming |
| **Math problem equaling 5** | $5 XRP price target |
| **"Jackpot!" with slot machine showing $11,106.78** (June 1, 2025) | $11+ XRP price target; the specific number decoded multiple ways |
| **Retirement joke** (January 2026) | Coincided with a 20% XRP pump to $2.40, spawning "Schwartz Effect" memes |

Schwartz typically responds to the community's decodings with **humor and denial**, posting memes or deflecting — which, of course, the community interprets as further confirmation that the messages are intentional.

## Brad Garlinghouse: The 589 Connection

### The Follow Count

The most discussed Garlinghouse-Riddler connection is his X (Twitter) follow count: **exactly 589 accounts**. The community considers this a deliberate signal, noting that a CEO of his profile would be aware of the significance of this number to his community. He has maintained this count for an extended period despite presumably following and unfollowing accounts.

### Key Statements Interpreted as Signals

- **"The XRP family has and always will be top of mind for Ripple"** — interpreted as a reaffirmation that XRP (not RLUSD) remains central to Ripple's vision
- **Warren Buffett quote**: "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful" — posted during XRP volatility, interpreted as a **buy signal**
- **"We're firing on all cylinders. It's happening."** — from a 2026 shareholder email, interpreted as confirmation of the community's long-held timeline expectations
- **Shareholder communications** emphasizing a "long view" on XRP — interpreted as patience before a major event

### What the Community Believes

The XRP community interprets Garlinghouse's behavior as that of someone who:

1. **Knows** the true potential value of XRP
2. **Cannot say it directly** due to legal and regulatory constraints (especially during the SEC lawsuit era)
3. **Uses subtle signals** — like the 589 follow count — to communicate with the community in ways that maintain plausible deniability
4. **Acknowledges the Riddlers** indirectly through imagery, numbers, and carefully worded statements

## Other Notable Figures

### The Broader Riddler Ecosystem

While BG123 and Mr. Pool are the two most prominent Riddlers, the culture extends to a broader ecosystem of accounts, analysts, and decoders:

#### Community Decoders & Analysts
- **Working Money Channel** — YouTube channel known for detailed BG123 and Mr. Pool analysis
- **Black Swan Capitalist** — Discusses XRP's role in economic resets and "Great Reset" theories
- **NCashOfficial** — YouTube channel covering Riddler content and XRP predictions
- **Crypto Eri** (@sentosumosaba) — Prominent XRP community figure who provides technical analysis and counters misinformation, bridging the gap between Riddler culture and mainstream XRP discourse

#### Connected Themes
- **The Roosevelt Bears** (Teddy B and Teddy G) — Historical children's book characters that BG123 referenced, interpreted as metaphors for market forces
- **The Economist 1988 Cover** — The famous "Get Ready for a World Currency" cover featuring a phoenix on burning fiat currencies — a recurring reference in Riddler imagery
- **Alice and Bob** — Computer science placeholder names used in Riddler content to describe token conversion processes (XRP to FXRP via Flare)

## Why XRP? Understanding the Riddler Phenomenon

### The Perfect Storm

XRP Riddler culture didn't emerge by accident. Several factors unique to XRP created the conditions for this phenomenon:

#### 1. The SEC Lawsuit (2020–2023)
The SEC's lawsuit against Ripple created years of **enforced silence** from the company. When officials can't speak freely, communities fill the void with interpretation. The lawsuit created an information vacuum that Riddlers and decoders rushed to fill.

#### 2. Suppressed Price
XRP's price remained relatively flat for years while other cryptocurrencies surged. This created a community of **patient, convicted holders** who needed narrative frameworks to sustain their belief. The Riddlers provided that framework — a story that explained the wait and promised the payoff.

#### 3. Institutional Use Case
Unlike meme coins or purely speculative assets, XRP has a **concrete utility story** — cross-border payments, institutional settlement, CBDC infrastructure. This gives Riddler narratives more surface area to work with. Every Ripple partnership, every regulatory development, every SWIFT mention becomes a potential decode.

#### 4. The Company Behind the Coin
Ripple Labs is a real company with real executives who post on social media. This creates opportunities for **pattern matching** that purely decentralized projects don't offer. When a CEO follows exactly 589 accounts, it feels intentional in a way that a faceless protocol can't replicate.

#### 5. Network Spirituality
The XRP Riddler community has developed what might be called **"network spirituality"** — a blend of technical utility belief, numerological interpretation, geopolitical analysis, and quasi-religious faith in XRP's destiny. This goes beyond typical crypto tribalism into something genuinely unique in the digital asset space.

### How It Differs from Other Crypto Communities

| Aspect | XRP Riddlers | Other Crypto Communities |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Communication style** | Cryptic images, riddles, coded numbers | Direct price predictions, technical analysis |
| **Time horizon** | Years-long patience, "the plan" | Short-term trading, quick gains |
| **Narrative structure** | Mythology, prophecy, hidden knowledge | Fundamentals, technology, market dynamics |
| **Relationship to project** | Believe in insider communication | Evaluate based on public information |
| **Community role** | Active decoding, collective interpretation | Individual analysis, social trading |
| **Resilience to failure** | Failed predictions are "early, not wrong" | Failed predictions lose followers |

### The Self-Reinforcing Loop

The Riddler ecosystem is remarkably resilient because of a self-reinforcing dynamic:

1. A Riddler posts a cryptic image
2. The community decodes it, generating multiple possible interpretations
3. When *any* interpretation partially aligns with a future event, it's counted as a "hit"
4. Misses are attributed to timing errors ("the plan shifted") rather than fundamental failures
5. Each hit increases the Riddler's perceived credibility
6. New followers join, increasing the decoding workforce
7. More decoders means more possible interpretations, increasing the probability of future "hits"

This isn't a criticism — it's a description of how all mythology and prophecy traditions sustain themselves. The XRP Riddler community has, perhaps unknowingly, replicated one of humanity's oldest cultural patterns in a digital context.

## A Note on Interpretation

The XRP Riddler tradition is one of the most fascinating cultural phenomena in cryptocurrency. It represents the community's collective attempt to make sense of uncertainty — to find patterns in chaos and meaning in waiting.

Whether the Riddlers are genuine insiders with foreknowledge, clever community members building narrative, or something in between, their impact on XRP culture is undeniable. The 589 meme alone has likely kept thousands of holders engaged through years of price stagnation and legal uncertainty.

The content presented here documents what the community believes, discusses, and theorizes. These are the stories the XRP community tells itself — and stories, as any anthropologist will tell you, are never "just" stories. They shape behavior, build communities, and sustain conviction through uncertainty.

**The reader is invited to explore, decode, and decide for themselves.**
