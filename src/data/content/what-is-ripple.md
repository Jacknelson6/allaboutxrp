Ripple is a San Francisco-based technology company that builds enterprise solutions for cross-border payments and digital asset infrastructure. Founded in 2012 as OpenCoin, it rebranded to Ripple Labs in 2013 and then simply Ripple in 2015.

Ripple's flagship product, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), uses XRP as a bridge currency to enable instant cross-border payments without pre-funded accounts. This solves a major pain point in international finance where trillions of dollars are locked in nostro/vostro accounts.

It's important to understand that Ripple and XRP are related but distinct. XRP is a decentralized digital asset that exists on the XRP Ledger — it would continue to function even if Ripple ceased to exist. Ripple is a private company that is one of many participants building on the XRPL ecosystem.
