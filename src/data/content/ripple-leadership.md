# Ripple Leadership

## Who Leads Ripple?

Ripple's leadership team combines fintech veterans, cryptography experts, and seasoned corporate executives. The company has maintained a relatively stable leadership structure, with several key figures guiding its strategy through rapid growth, regulatory challenges, and the landmark SEC lawsuit.

## Brad Garlinghouse — Chief Executive Officer

Brad Garlinghouse has served as CEO of Ripple since January 2017, succeeding co-founder Chris Larsen. Before joining Ripple, Garlinghouse held executive roles at AOL (as President of Consumer Applications), Hightail (as CEO), and Yahoo, where he authored the famous "Peanut Butter Manifesto" calling for the company to focus its strategy.

As CEO, Garlinghouse has steered Ripple through its most consequential period, including the SEC lawsuit filed in December 2020 that named him as a co-defendant. He has been a vocal advocate for regulatory clarity in the United States and has publicly criticized the SEC's approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Under his leadership, Ripple expanded its global payments network to over 55 countries and launched the RLUSD stablecoin in December 2024.

## Chris Larsen — Executive Chairman and Co-Founder

Chris Larsen co-founded the company (originally OpenCoin) in September 2012 and served as its first CEO until 2016. A serial fintech entrepreneur, Larsen previously co-founded E-Loan (one of the first online mortgage companies) and Prosper Marketplace (a peer-to-peer lending platform).

Larsen was also named as a co-defendant in the SEC's 2020 lawsuit. At various points during XRP's price peaks, his personal XRP holdings reportedly made him one of the wealthiest individuals in the cryptocurrency industry. He remains involved in Ripple's strategic direction as Executive Chairman.

## David Schwartz — Chief Technology Officer

David Schwartz is one of the three original creators of the XRP Ledger and has served as Ripple's CTO since its earliest days. A cryptographer with experience dating to the 1980s, Schwartz designed the XRP Ledger's consensus protocol and continues to oversee the company's technical strategy.

Known in the XRP community by his online handle "JoelKatz," Schwartz is a frequent presence at industry conferences and on social media, where he explains technical developments and engages with developers building on the XRPL. He is widely regarded as one of the foremost experts on the XRP Ledger's architecture.

## Monica Long — President

Monica Long joined Ripple in September 2013 as one of the company's first dozen employees, initially serving as Director of Communications. She advanced through roles including VP and SVP of Marketing before being promoted to President.

As President, Long leads Ripple's Business, Product, and Engineering teams. She has been a key figure in the company's enterprise sales strategy and its expansion into new markets, including stablecoins and custody services.

## Stuart Alderoty — Chief Legal Officer

Stuart Alderoty joined Ripple as General Counsel and has served as the company's Chief Legal Officer. He played a central role in Ripple's defense against the SEC lawsuit, coordinating legal strategy throughout the multi-year case. Alderoty has been an outspoken critic of what he characterizes as regulation by enforcement in the U.S. cryptocurrency industry.

## Key Technical and Advisory Figures

### Arthur Britto — Co-Creator of the XRP Ledger

Arthur Britto co-created the XRP Ledger alongside David Schwartz and Jed McCaleb. He was instrumental in designing XRP's economic model, including the fixed 100 billion token supply. Britto has remained largely out of the public eye since the ledger's creation.

### Jed McCaleb — Co-Creator (Departed 2013)

Jed McCaleb initiated the XRP Ledger project and co-founded OpenCoin before departing in 2013. He went on to co-found Stellar (XLM). McCaleb's XRP holdings were governed by a structured sale agreement, and his final XRP distributions were completed in 2022.

## Leadership Through Crisis

Ripple's leadership was tested significantly by the SEC lawsuit, which began in December 2020 and continued through 2025. Rather than settling early, the company chose to fight the case — a decision that proved consequential when Judge Torres ruled in July 2023 that XRP sold on public exchanges is not a security. This legal clarity benefited not just Ripple but the broader cryptocurrency industry, and the leadership team's willingness to litigate has been cited as a turning point for crypto regulation in the United States.
