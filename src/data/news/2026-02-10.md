### Ripple Expands UAE Partnership with Zand Bank for RLUSD Infrastructure

Ripple deepened its strategic partnership with Zand Bank, a UAE-based digital bank, to build out stablecoin infrastructure connecting RLUSD with Zand's AED-pegged stablecoin (AEDZ). The collaboration focuses on three key areas: institutional custody services, a liquidity bridge between RLUSD and AEDZ, and the direct issuance of AEDZ on the XRP Ledger. This move positions XRP Ledger as a backbone for multi-currency on-chain transactions in one of the world's most crypto-forward regulatory environments, and signals Ripple's growing ambitions in the Middle East corridor.

### Doppler Finance x OpenEden: Yield on RLUSD via Tokenized Treasuries

Announced today, Doppler Finance and OpenEden have teamed up to allow holders of XRP and RLUSD to generate yield from tokenized U.S. Treasury bonds directly on the XRP Ledger. This is a significant milestone for real-world asset (RWA) integration — it means RLUSD holders can now park their stablecoins in yield-bearing instruments without ever leaving the XRPL ecosystem. The collaboration comes as tokenized assets on the XRP Ledger have surged **266% over the past 30 days**, reaching a total value of $1.45 billion.

### 21Shares Publishes 2026 XRP Outlook: Base Case $2.45

Institutional research firm 21Shares released their comprehensive XRP outlook report, assigning a **50% probability** to a base-case target of **$2.45**, a 30% chance of hitting **$2.69** in a bull scenario, and pegging the bear case at **$1.60**. The report emphasizes that regulatory clarity from the SEC settlement and the build-out of institutional rails — particularly Permissioned Domains and the upcoming Permissioned DEX — are the primary catalysts for upside.

## Price Action

XRP is trading at approximately **$1.44** as of this afternoon, consolidating within a tight range of **$1.39 to $1.45** over the past 24 hours.

**Key levels to watch:**

- **Support:** $1.39 (today's low), with stronger support at $1.22 (the Feb 6 swing low that marked an oversold RSI bounce)
- **Resistance:** $1.45 (today's high), then the $1.52–$1.54 zone that capped prices earlier this month
- **Trend:** XRP is recovering from last week's selloff that briefly pushed prices to $1.216 on February 6. The RSI bounce from oversold territory has brought buyers back, but momentum remains cautious

Volume has been moderate across major exchanges. The broader crypto market is also in consolidation mode following last week's volatility, with Bitcoin hovering near its own key support levels. XRP's correlation with BTC remains elevated — a breakout or breakdown in Bitcoin will likely dictate XRP's next major move.

For the bulls, reclaiming and holding above $1.50 would be a significant technical milestone. For the bears, a daily close below $1.38 would put the $1.22 support back in play.

## On-Chain & Development

### RLUSD Market Cap Hits $1.49 Billion

Ripple's USD stablecoin continues its impressive growth trajectory, now sitting at a market capitalization of approximately **$1.49 billion** — closing in on the $1.5B milestone. RLUSD has benefited from a string of institutional integrations and the growing tokenized asset ecosystem on XRPL.

### Tokenized Assets on XRPL Surge to $1.45B

The total value of real-world assets tokenized on the XRP Ledger has exploded **266.85%** over the past month to reach **$1.45 billion**. This includes tokenized treasuries, commodities, and other financial instruments. The Doppler Finance x OpenEden integration announced today will only accelerate this trend.

### Permissioned DEX Launch: February 18

One of the most anticipated infrastructure upgrades is just around the corner. The **Permissioned DEX**, scheduled to go live on **February 18**, will enable institution-only liquidity pools for regulated participants on the XRP Ledger. This builds on the Permissioned Domains feature that went live earlier, allowing institutions to operate in compliant, access-controlled environments. Industry analysts believe this could unlock billions in institutional capital that has been waiting on the sidelines for proper compliance infrastructure.

### Securosys & Figment Partnership

Announced yesterday (Feb 9), Ripple's partnership with Securosys and Figment adds hardware-security-module (HSM) based custody and staking services to the Ripple ecosystem. While the staking component initially covers Ethereum and Solana, the custody infrastructure strengthens the overall institutional offering — making it easier for traditional financial players to interact with the XRP Ledger securely.

## Community Buzz

The XRP community is buzzing about several topics today:

**Permissioned DEX countdown:** With only 8 days until launch, the community is debating the potential impact. Optimists see it as the key to unlocking institutional flows; skeptics argue institutional adoption will be gradual regardless of infrastructure readiness.

**21Shares price targets:** The $2.45 base case has generated lively discussion. Many community members see it as conservative given the ecosystem developments, while others appreciate the measured, data-driven approach compared to the more speculative $10+ predictions circulating on social media.

**RLUSD vs. competitors:** As RLUSD approaches the $1.5B market cap milestone, the community is drawing comparisons to USDC's early growth trajectory. The Zand Bank partnership in particular has sparked conversation about RLUSD's potential as a bridge currency in the Middle East remittance corridor.

**Post-SEC clarity era:** Six months after the official conclusion of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, the community continues to celebrate the regulatory clarity. Ripple's $50M settlement and the clear ruling that XRP is not a security in retail transactions has been a catalyst for institutional on-ramping and ETF discussions.

## What to Watch

- **February 18: Permissioned DEX launch** — The biggest near-term catalyst for institutional adoption on the XRP Ledger. Watch for announcement of launch partners and initial liquidity commitments.

- **RLUSD hitting $1.5B** — At the current growth rate, RLUSD should cross this psychological milestone within days. Watch for potential Ripple announcement to mark the occasion.

- **Bitcoin's next move** — XRP remains highly correlated with BTC. The broader market's direction will heavily influence whether XRP can reclaim $1.50+ or retests lower supports.

- **XRP ETF developments** — With regulatory clarity established, multiple asset managers have signaled interest in XRP-based exchange-traded products. Any filing updates or SEC commentary could move markets.

- **Tokenized asset momentum** — The 266% monthly surge in XRPL tokenized assets is a trend worth monitoring closely. New partnerships and integrations could push this figure significantly higher.

*That's your daily XRP wrap. See you tomorrow.*
