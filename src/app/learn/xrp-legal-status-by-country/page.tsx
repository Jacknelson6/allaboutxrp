A small number of countries have banned all cryptocurrencies, which includes XRP." },

    { question: "Is XRP a security?", answer: "In the US, Judge Torres ruled in July 2023 that XRP sales on exchanges are not securities transactions. This was a landmark ruling in the SEC v Ripple case. Other jurisdictions generally classify XRP as a virtual asset, cryptocurrency, or commodity — not a security." },
    { question: "Is XRP legal in the European Union?", answer: "Yes. XRP is fully legal across all 27 EU member states. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation provides a comprehensive framework for crypto assets. Exchanges must register and comply with MiCA requirements." },
    { question: "Where is XRP most popular?", answer: "XRP has the strongest adoption in Japan (via SBI Holdings partnership), South Korea, the United States, United Kingdom, and the Philippines (via remittance corridors). Japan's SBI Group has been Ripple's most active institutional partner." },
