  { q: "How does XRP 'make money'?", a: "XRP doesn't make money like a company. It gains value through supply and demand. As more banks use it for payments, more people want to hold it, and the supply is limited — these forces push the price up." },
  { q: "What drives XRP's price up?", a: "Four main things: (1) Real utility — banks using XRP for payments, (2) Growing adoption — more partnerships and corridors, (3) Limited supply — only 100B XRP will ever exist, with some burned forever, (4) Market sentiment and speculation." },
  { q: "Can you earn passive income with XRP?", a: "Yes, but not from XRP itself. You can earn yield by providing liquidity in XRPL AMM pools, lending XRP on platforms, or participating in DeFi. These are separate activities from simply holding XRP." },
  { q: "What makes XRP more valuable over time?", a: "If the thesis plays out: more banks adopt ODL → more XRP is needed for transactions → more demand with fixed supply → higher price. Plus ETF approvals, CBDC bridging, and tokenized assets all increase demand." },
  { q: "Does XRP have a maximum supply?", a: "Yes. There will only ever be 100 billion XRP. A tiny amount is destroyed (burned) with every transaction. This means the total supply slowly decreases over time, making each remaining XRP slightly more scarce." },
  { q: "How does Ripple make money from XRP?", a: "Ripple holds billions of XRP (mostly in escrow) and can sell them. Ripple also earns revenue from its enterprise software, RLUSD stablecoin, and Ripple Prime brokerage — XRP sales are just one revenue stream." },

        <TLDRBox>
          <p>XRP gains value through <strong className="text-text-primary">supply and demand</strong>. When banks use XRP for <Link href="/learn/on-demand-liquidity" className="text-xrp-accent underline decoration-xrp-accent/30">cross-border payments</Link>, they need to buy it — creating demand. There are only 100 billion XRP (and some are <Link href="/learn/xrp-burn-rate" className="text-xrp-accent underline decoration-xrp-accent/30">burned forever</Link> with each transaction). More demand + limited supply = higher price. It&apos;s that simple.</p>
